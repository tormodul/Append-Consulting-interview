### Model choice

Why openai/gpt-4o-mini?
- OpenAI solution (selling point)
- more cost effective than gpt-4o
- still powerful enough for the task
- available on OpenRouter


Also used the Mistral: Mistral 7B Instruct (free) for testing:
- This one had some structure issues in the output, but was still quite good.
